# Very Useful Tools.

### Objective

- Manage all tools you think is useful.
- Make it easy to find the best tools for your task using filters

### Running

First of all, you need to make sure to istall all the dependency. Go to api folder and run `yarn install`.

Then you can run tests:

- `yarn test`

To run it you can just use docker.
On root folder run:

- `docker-compose up --build -d`

### API Documentation
